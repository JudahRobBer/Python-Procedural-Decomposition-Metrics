Codebase outlining the development of a limited suite of metrics for the evaluation of CS1 proceedurally written python code.
Currently emphasizes the count of multiple output functions, high data complexity functions, and reusability counts.
Contains supporting code to enable other forms of analysis, includes per function complexity analysis and other aspects of code
structure such as the ratio of low-abstraction to high-abstraction functions and detected violations of the single layer of abstraction principle.


The Codebase currently has no outwards facing API, examples for potential use are included in dataAnalyzer.py
